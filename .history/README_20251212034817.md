# Django

## Creating a Django Project

- When Creating a django project it is always important to create a virtual environment.

```python
python -m venv .venv
```

- After that it is important to install Django.

```python
python -m pip install Django  
```

- To create a django project we use the command.
  
```python
django-admin startproject smartnotes  
```

## Creating an App

- Due to the Django MVT/MVC Architecture, Django was trying to ensure that the wide projects is broken down into small apps.
- To create an app inside the Django project we use the command.

```python
django-admin startapp home
```

- home is the name of the app inside the smartnotes project
- The app is then defined in the INSTALLED_APPS array in the settings.py

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    .
    .
    .
    
    # Apps
    'home',
]
```

- Now in the home app, we go to the views.py file and import HttpResponse from django.http.
- Then define the functions in the view

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World")
```

- Now in the project under urls.py we need to define a path to that view.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from home import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home', views.home)
]
```

## The MVT framework

- Django uses Model View Template framework.

- Model - Handles Data.
- View - Responsible for handling request and responses.
- Template - Allow us to render data into html pages.

## Template pages

- To use the .html page files one creates a template folder inside the app and inside the template folder you create another folder with the name of the app.
- Now of the views.py, you can render the pages correctly.

```python
def welcome(request):
    return render(request, "home/welcome.html", {'today': datetime.today()}) 
```

- urls.py

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from home import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('home', views.home),
    path('', views.welcome)
]

```
